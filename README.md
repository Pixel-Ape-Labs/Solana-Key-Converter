# Solana-Key-Converter
 Convert your Solana private key from Base58 to Uint8Array

Basic requirements:
NPM and NODE.JS

First install base58 in the folder by using:
`npm install bs58`

Then simply run:
`node convert.js`

Paste your private key and hit enter. You will get the Uint8Array json format [number,number,number] to copy paste from the terminal.
This code doesn't save your private key anywhere, it's discrete as the Solana meme coin DEVS.
